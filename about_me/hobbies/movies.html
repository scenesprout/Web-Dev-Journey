            Star Wars! <br/><br/>
            Was there ever any doubt? If you have seen my fave games and know how much I love fantasy and scifi, there is only one movie that 
            can be in the number one slot! I know that lately there is a bit of a divide amongst the fan base, and I do wish that the newer movies werent treated so irresponsibly, 
            But I love all of the movies still. The new shows are epic like The Mandolorian. I would agree that nothing really tops the original 3 Ep, 4,5 and 6. But when you watch any Star Wars movie, can you truly say you were bored?
            The light sabers. The force. The ships. The planets. The characters and life styeles. Cool bounty hunters with jetpacks. Come on! Whats not to love here! Any were you go in this world you will always find a fan!

            Aladdin! <br/><br/>
            I can show you the world. Shining shimmering splended! Yea I at one point could quote this whole movie word for word. I litterally wore the dang VHS tape out 
            in the first month. It played back to back every single day. I have seen it more than 100 times Im sure, not that I ever truly counted. How could I?
            I was busy watching lol. I even really enjoyed the new live action movie. You can't replace Robin Williams as the Genie, but Will Smith did a really good job.

            Tron! <br/><br/>
            Although there are many movies I could put in this spot like Shawshank Redemption, Contact, Gladiator, Troy. the Tolkien Saga,
            Tron will always stand out to me as it came out when I was a kid and my imagination was at its most influential. Computers, video games and the 
            thought of being able to enter this digital realm were things that just seems so epic at the time, and honestly still do! Tron VR game please! Those light 
            cycles, the sounds, the bits and there binary yes and no answers. The data disks and how the zipped around when tossed and where a way for, the 
            programs to defend and attack. Brilliant! For its time it was cutting edge  movie visuals and some of the first computer aided grphics in all of film! 
            The sequal may not have been received well by the critics but I loved it! I bumped that sound track for month and imagined myself in the grid, at 30 something, to have 
            a movie capture my imagination like that, ya know it was good!

            Honorable Mentions! <br/><br/>
            As with music, I love movies too much to really limit it to 3 but couldn't possibly choose which movies would be 4th 5th or even 27th. 
            I will go ahead and just toss out some movies that have always stood out to me as amazing pieces of film! Dances with Wolves, Lonesome Dove, 
            Shawshank Redemption, The Tolkien saga, Harry Potter Saga, Contact, Tombstone, Labyrinth, and many many more.
