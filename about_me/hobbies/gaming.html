                The Legend of Zelda! <br/><br/> We won't mention the ones from the CDi. All the rest are amazing games and quite a few of them are master pieces 
                hailed as greatest games of all times! Im looking at you Tears of the Kindgom and Ocarina of Time.

                Final Fantasy VII! <br/><br/>
                Before this game, I had only ever played Racing, Action, and Adventuer games. I loved to read fantasy and sci-fi books
                when not gaming and this game did a mix of both. It blew me away. The story was as deep as any I had ever read, but this let me
                make choices in how the characters moved through out the story. I got to choose the powers they wielded and the equipment they carried.
                Best of all! I got to see the world they lived in. See the characters strugles first hand like I was there, not just reading about it.
                Sure there are others in the series that could be called better in many ways, but this one was what started it all for me and the one that opened my eyes to the world of RPGs!

                Gran Turismo! <br/><br/>
                Who dosn't love racing? I at one point, wanted to seriously race cars and Gran Turismo gave me the closest feeling to
                legally being able to do so. I can't say I could pick just one as they all have their ups and downs. However,
                Gran Turismo 2, 4 and 7 have to be the ones I have played the most. 2 was my first one and it had so many dang cars and tracks and mods.
                You could play it forever and never use every car to its fullest potential! 7 is a whole lot of fun as well when using the PSCR 2 Headset and the
                full racgin wheel with foot pedals and stick shifter!

                Metroid! <br/><br/>
                This game was around during my first years as a gamer, however. It wouldn't be until I got a Gameboy Advance and played Metroid: Fusion.
                I was floored! This was basically Zelda but in space. Sure its a side scroller, but you still gather power ups and new tools to help you explore the world and venture further into its deepest and most secretive locations.
                This would lead me to play the other Metroids. I can't say that any of them are bad at all. Every single one is amazing, well, lets not talk about Other M... Save for that one,
                this series is all a buynch of top notch gaming experiences!

                Ridge Racer! <br/><br/>
                So we already know I love racing. And with Gran Turismo it is all realistic simulation style races. With Ridge Racer, it's all about flashy fun arcade racing.
                And drifting. All of the tracks have giant tight corners for your to whip the back end of your car around like a madman at breakneck speeds. All the while you have an announcer that sounds more like a DJ,
                cheering you on. Yelling out stuff like "Yeah! Keep Going! Last Lap! He's right behind you!" honestly I usually turn him and the music off as its a bit much.
                The crazy fun of the racing and the wild drifting tracks are always a good time.

                Terraria! <br/><br/>
                From the moment the music starts playing at the start screen, I am stoked to be booting this game up again. I have purchased this game on every paltform it has been released on,
                and completed it on most of them. So whats it about? It's a sandbox game similar in style to Minecraft, but is all sidescroller and the worls is not infinite.
                The game revolves around you digging and finding treasure. Building a base to house those treasures. Using the ores and monster parts you gather to
                Create bigger better and faster characters. You can craft random objects to give you and edge in combat and exploration like, ehem, a "Fart in a Bottle" which allows you to jump twice! Hehe
                There is way way too much to this game to put into a littel paragraph, so I will leave it to you to just YouTube a few videos and you will see what I mean.

                Minecraft! <br/><br/>
                Perhaps you saw that coming after my listing for Terraria? I mean whats not to love about being able to have a basically infinte landscape to explore,
                dig into, build around, and of course, Run from those creepy Endermen! Oh. And have half you base blown up by that creeper you didn't know was there until it went "BOOM!"
                How many of us had to change a few pairs of pants do to those dang things?

                Phantasy Star Online! <br/><br/>
                Ok so let me start by saying, this list is not fully in order of most fave to least fave. It is a bit all over the place.
                Zelda and FF VII are def up there and so is Gran Turismo, but no other game has taken SO many hours from me over years like Phantasy Star Online
                and its iterations. I never really got into Phantasy Star Online 2, but when we talk about Online, Universe and the Portables. Oh man. I 
                really can't say just how many hours I have put into these games. Sci fi. Action RPG. Laser guns. Cool music. High level caps. Multiple classes to master.
                Mutliple dungeons and randomly spawning events. This game is a blast and I will probably play these games until I am no longer able to play any game!

                Animal Crossing! <br/><br/>
                Ah, Animal Crossing. A quite little nook, see what I did there?, in the video game universe where you get to just chill!
                Take things at your own pace. Dig for fossils. Go fishing for that elusive winter fish you didn't catch last year. Yeah, thats right.
                Last year! Because, the game goes off of the real world clock and calendar. The seasons change, holidays come and go. Its a fun game with so much to do and enjoy,
                and so many different types of villagers that could move into your tiny little village. Just remember to pay ol Tom Nook his bells back so you can
                go back into debt with him again and have an even bigger house built to house your crazy furniture with zanny themes. Or maybe youd rather just help Blathers
                with his museum collection? Sit back and enjoy the ride cause this game could take you...years!

            <li>
                Elder Scrolls! <br/><br/>
                Ok yea, I get that this is a whole series like with Zelda. But come one! I can't just pick one. They are all so good. Skyrim
                has the most hours put in, but its also the least in depth when it comes to builds and class styles. Oblivion had more polish than
                Morrowind, but the combat wasn't as fluid as SKyrim. Morrowind had a much more in depth RPG system that begged for you to become a very OP version of
                whatever madness you imagined up. Just the fact that you could enchant some shoes with "Constant Effect" Levitation and walk into the air and over anything
                meant there was far more options. Do the same thing with gloves and weapons and you could equip a glove and have some OP conjured ghost weapon appear in your hand.
                Sadly the rest of the series removed this fun little enchantment and you could no longer constant effect anything. BUT you could still enchant your gear with some impressive stuff!
                I could go on with the goods the bads and the uglies of these games butover all they are timeless classics that almost every gamer has spent far too many hours\
                exploring their wonderful worlds!
